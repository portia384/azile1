                        <p class="title">Sinach Background
                            Osinachi Egbu Joseph (née Kalu) was born on the 30th of March 1973, in Ebonyi State, as the second child of her parents. She had her early education at her village in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. After obtaining her WAEC certificate, Sinach went on to study physics at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.
                            
                            Sinach got married to Mr Joseph Egbu in 2014, and they are blessed with a lovely child.
                            
                            Her parents have always been her role model, so she got her tenacity and deep love for people and God from her father. The anointed gospel singer also possesses her mother’s wisdom, ability to organize, create things, and see beyond the ordinary. She describes Pastor Chris Oyakhilome as her mentor, life coach, and spiritual father.   <a href=" https://briefly.co.za/27141-dumi-mkokstad-biography-age-wedding-parents-albums-songs.html">readmore</a></p>.
