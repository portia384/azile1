            <h1 class="center">ABOUT GOSPEL MUSIC</h1>
                <p>Christian and Gospel is the sound of the devout putting their faith into song. While requiems, hymns, and gospel have long been part of worship, Christian-themed popular music has been going strong for decades. Gospel vocal groups such as the Soul Stirrers toured nationally 
                 the late-1920s through the '60s, spreading the Word to Beatles-worthy squeals from adoring young fans. The Mighty Clouds of Joy kept
                the tradition going in the '70s, changing the classic sound of a gospel quartet just enough to score a Disco hit along the way.
                their material in contemporary musical styles became known as Christian artists. The '70s and '80s saw Christian acts with little or no 
                spel overtones become a legitimate force in the music industry, and various subgenres have, from time to time, experienced brief flurries of 
                 devotional acts, from the heaven's Metal of Stryper in the '80s to the Pearl Jam-esque Alternative Christian popularized by Jars of Clay in the '90s
                 ere are many sub-styles of Christian music, all bearing the same fundamental message of encouragement in musical form.</p>

                 <p> Gospel music provides a way for people to maintain balance in their lives. Music allows people to uphold a balance between their career,
                faith, family and daily lives. Gospel music allows individuals to stay at an even keel; the right song can deliver the perfect message that
            can help when things appear off balance.</p>

               <h3 class="color">Music That Transcends Boundaries Of Age And Generations</h3>
               <p> Gospel music is family friendly, which means that your kids will not stumble across inappropriate messages or content.
                Composers of gospel music have to create music that is line with Christian values and expectations. To protect your family and instill 
                 in your children, listening to gospel music at home plays a critical role in teaching important lessons on morality and respect – as well as common truths we all share as human beings.</li>
                
               <h3 class="color">Enriching To Both Ear, Soul, Heart, And Mind</h2>
                Listening to gospel music is not only entertaining, but it can also be a source of enrichment. Gospel music tends to be inspirational
                and it can feed your soul to its very core. This strengthens your faith and spirituality, which provides a good foundation for your spiritual growth.
                
                <h3 class="color">Music To Find Balance</h3>
                Gospel music provides a way for people to maintain balance in their lives. Music allows people to uphold a balance between their career, faith,
                family and daily lives. Gospel music allows individuals to stay at an even keel; the right song can deliver the perfect message that can help when things appear off balance. Gospel music can also re-center you, allowing you to focus and move on even when things appear bleak and hopeless. Want to take up the equilibration up a notch? Using an essential oil diffuser creates the right atmosphere along with the music – making for a powerful experience. 
                
                <h3 class="color"> Just A Closer Walk With The Lord</h3>
                In regards to Christian music or any worship songs, the lyrics and the message included can go a long way in helping to strengthen an individual’s faith in God.
               Gospel music allows you to feel in touch with a higher power and can help to make you feel closer to Him and more devout.
                
                <h3 class="color">Music To Keep You Woke</h3>
                music reminds Christians of the secular world that they live in, which helps to remind them that there is a higher power at work. The music also helps to keep Christians self-aware and more connected to their spirituality.
                This point cannot be belabored on enough – regardless of your faith, there is always something to learn by learning about OTHERS’ faith. 
                 always something to take away from listening to gospel music and the stories of the people who wrote, sang, and literally lived their art.</p>
